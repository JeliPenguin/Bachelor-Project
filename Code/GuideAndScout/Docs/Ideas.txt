Check if data recieved is in predefined range:
- If agent/treat position are within the grid
- If reward is within certain range?

Training an inner "Message unnoising DL model"?
- But would be difficult recovering the original message
- Better approach would be detection of corruption in sent data, then requesting resending

Attempt Recovery of Message:
- Keep history of consecutive correctly recieved/correctly recovered messages
- Using a true checksum message as anchor for GUIDE position and TREAT position
