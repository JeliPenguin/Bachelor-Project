Data integrity Verification Methods: E.g. Checksum

Communication with other scouts about recieved data

History of recieved messages: See if currently recieved message make sense
- E.g. Detection of a skip in states

Check if data recieved is in predefined range:
- If agent/treat position are within the grid
- If reward is within certain range 
  (Maybe want to fix reward to fix binary, e.g. either -1 or 5, but not robust method)

Training an inner "Message unnoising DL model"?
- But would be difficult recovering the original message
- Better approach would be detection of corruption in sent data, then requesting resending
